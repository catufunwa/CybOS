What is CybOS?
--------------

A simple operating system kernel written for educational purposes. Capable of doing more than 95% of all (hobby)OS'es, which is to say, still not much :) 

Do not expect:
- Something functional to replace your linux|macosx|windows box with.
- Bugfree stuff.
- A nice installation
- 64bit in the near future
- the spanish inquisition

Expect:
- Bootloader to bootstrap the kernel
- A kernel capable of initializing most basic stuff (VMM, scheduling, disk I/O, vfs)

Expect in the near future:
- newlib port so we can write (userland) applications.
- IPv4 support
